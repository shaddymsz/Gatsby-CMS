.</p>
                    <p>There are numerous factors that determine the life insurance premium rates, as follows:</p>
                    <p><strong>Mortality Rate:</strong>  The age of the insured will determine the predicted mortality rate of that particular age group. This is the most crucial factor for deciding the insurance premium. The younger the individual, the more likely that insurers are likely to offer a better rate of premium as the chances of a claim being made are less.</p>
                    <p><strong>Earnings from investments:</strong>
Since paid premiums are used to pay life insurance claims, the earnings from these investments are important from the company's point of view.</p>
                    <p><strong>Personal habits and Health Record:</strong>
Unhealthy lifestyle habits like smoking, alcoholism etc. will result in a 30% to 70% higher premium charged by <a href="https://www.coverfox.com/life-insurance/life-insurance-companies/">life insurance companies</a> in comparison to individuals leading a healthy lifestyle.</p>
                    <p><strong>Coverage or Sum Assured:</strong>

                        <p><strong>Step 1 -</strong>
The policy buyer must first enter important personal details that are required such as:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Date of birth</li>

                            <li>Annual income</li>
                            <li>Number of children</li>
                            <li>Marital status</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Step 2 -</strong>
After entering personal details, you must enter details regarding the policy such as follows:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The sum that you wish to have insured</li>
                            <li>Desired length of the policy term</li>
                            <li>Premium Payment Term or Tenure</li>
                            <li>How often you would wish to pay (annually, semi-annually, quarterly, monthly)</li>
                            <li>Additional riders you may wish to include
You can also make a selection regarding whether the payout should be lumpsum or as monthly income. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Step 3 -</strong> 
The last step ends with the insurance calculator displaying the best premiums and insurance policies available as per the individual's information. The plans suggested must then be compared and the most advantageous plan should be selected for future use.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><p>Ten times your current income:
This is a good place to start, but it does not consider all the factors. The drawbacks of this rule are that:
•   It does not take a detailed look at all the requirements of a family
•   It does not consider existing life insurance policies
•   It does not provide cover for stay-at-home parents</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><p>Ten times your current income and an additional amount for your child's college expenses
This addition still does not cover all the aspects that should be considered when looking for a life insurance plan.</p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li><p>Calculate using the DIME Formula
DIME stands for Debts and expenses, income, mortgage, education.</p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p><strong>Debts and expenses:</strong> All the existing debts and expenses should be summed up</p>
                                <p><strong>Income:</strong> The number of years that your family would require financial support must be calculated, and multiplied with current annual income. The number of years must be considered as the number of years it would take for your youngest child to graduate from school.</p>
                                <p><strong>Mortgage:</strong> The amount of money that is needed to pay off mortgage is calculated</p>
                                <p><strong>Education:</strong> The amount of money that is required for your children’s' college education is considered.
The best way to find the ideal coverage for life insurance is to add up your financial obligations (mortgage, debts, future needs) and subtract liquid assets (savings, current life insurance) from this.</p>
