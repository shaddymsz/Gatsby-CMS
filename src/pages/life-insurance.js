Opting for a life insurance cover can protect the policyholder's family from financial strain in case of an unfortunate event, like when the individual passes away.</p>
                            <p><strong>Life Insurance</strong> is a straightforward concept – you basically buy a policy that offers your beneficiary or beneficiary's compensation when you are no more. You need to have thorough knowledge about life insurance to be able to take a well-informed decision about the type of life insurance policy that will be best suited for your unique needs, the amount of death benefit that you should opt for, etc. Since human life is very precious, you get financially as well as emotionally disturbed when you lose a family member. In such challenging circumstances, life insurance policies offer the much-needed financial peace to your family in your absence.
It provides them a lump sum or pay outs in installments, as mutually decided between you and your insurance company at the time of signing the policy. This ensures your family a reliable and stable source of income for meeting basic needs like child’s education, daily expenses, unpaid bank loans or debts (if any), etc.</p>

The British Raj established the Oriental Life Insurance Company as an initiative to insure themselves. Life insurance policies were made available to Indians much later. Let’s look back at the other achievements and milestones:</p>
                                        <p><strong>1912:</strong> The Indian Life Assurance Act was introduced for efficient management of life insurance in India.</p>
                                        <p><strong>1928:</strong> The Indian Insurance Companies Act was formulated to empower the Government to secure and maintain a database of insurance companies specializing in the life as well as non-life insurance sector.</p>
                                        <p><strong>1938:</strong> The Indian Act was amended to align the insurance laws to the public interest.</p>
                                        <p><strong>1956:</strong> The LIC Act was passed, leading to the establishment of the Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), the first major step towards the nationalization of the life insurance industry in India.</p>
                                        <p><strong>1971:</strong> General Insurance Corporation of India or GIC was, incorporated nationalizing the non-life insurance in India.</p>
                                        <p><strong>1993:</strong> The Malhotra Committee came into force.</p>
                                        <p><strong>1999:</strong> Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), was formed as an autonomous body to regulate and develop the insurance industry.</p>
                                        <p><strong>1997:</strong> General Insurance Corporation, Life Insurance Corporation of India, and its subsidiaries are declared autonomous from the Government. This independence ensured them the flexibility to formulate their own policies and set their security standards.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Status of Life Insurance in India Today:</strong> As on 2018, there are 24 life insurance companies operating in the life insurance business in India, as per IRDAI (Insurance regulatory and Development Authority of India) records. Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) is a Central Government-owned body, while the others are private life insurance companies.</p>

                                    <div className="tsic__content" data-cms-content="md:sectionTabItemContent"><p>Before you buy a life insurance policy, it is essential for you to have in-depth knowledge about how different plans work. This will help you opt for a life insurance policy that is best suited to your needs from a reliable insurance company. Here is the process in which a life insurance policy works:</p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><p><strong>Premium payment and policy benefits:</strong> It is important to ensure timely payments of the pre-determined premium, as mutually decided between the policyholder and the insurance company. Premium payments throughout the policy tenure ensure that the policyholder’s beneficiary/beneficiaries will receive the pre-decided lump sum from the insurance company in the event of his/her unforeseen demise. Instead of a lump sum, the policyholder can opt for payments to be made in instalments to the beneficiary/beneficiaries after his/her sudden death. The insurance company may also pay bonuses, based on the amount that has been accumulated over the policy tenure.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li><p><strong>Claim settlement:</strong> After the death of the policyholder, the beneficiary or a relative of the deceased has to get in touch with the insurance company to initiate the claim settlement process. A copy of the policyholder’s death certificate will have to be presented as proof, along with other necessary documents as required by the company. It generally takes a week or fortnight or a month for the insurance company to review the claim and then decide on whether to accept or reject the claim. The entire claim settlement process usually takes one to two months or even less. Though there is no fixed tenure for completing the process, insurance companies make an effort to expedite the process to avoid having to pay hefty rates of interest on late payment of the sum assured.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li><p><strong>Reasons for delay/rejection in claim settlement:</strong> There may be certain instances that can cause delay in the claim settlement procedure. For instance, investigating the chances of fraudulent practices. Causes of death from suicide within a year of opting for a life insurance policy leads to claim rejection. Death due to certain medical and health conditions may also be excluded in the policy.</p>
                                            </li>
                                            <li><p><strong>Loan against policy on hospitalization or critical illnesses:</strong> Some insurance companies offer the option of withdrawing cash against the life insurance policy for emergencies like treatment of critical illnesses and emergency hospitalization. Policyholders can take a loan by submitting the necessary documents along with a letter that specifies the reason behind opting for a loan.</p>
                                            </li>
                                        </ul>

                            <p>The salient features and benefits of term life insurance plans are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>For term insurance policies, the beneficiary can avail the lump sum only if the policyholder dies during the policy tenure. After the maturation of the policy, the insurance company is not liable to return the premiums paid. It is a pure life cover with no maturity benefits.</li>
                                <li>These are offered for a fixed term, as suggested by the name.</li>
                                <li>They do not include cash value, which explains why they are more affordable than other life insurance plans.</li>
                                <li>One of the most traditional insurance plans, they are very reasonable and, therefore, easily accessible for everyone.

                                <li>Life insurance companies in India generally offer term life insurance policies for tenures of 10 or 20 or 30 or 40 years.
One of the primary benefits of these plans is that they may come with a built-in option that enables the policyholder to convert them into permanent life insurance plans.</li>
                                <li>It offers applicants to select the sum assured / premium amount and premium payment frequency - annual, semi-annual, quarterly to monthly, as per his/her convenience. The total premium amount can be paid in the form of a lump-sum as opposed to payments at pre-determined intervals.</li>
                                <li>A term policy is suitable for policyholders who do not expect to get a return for the entire premium payment after maturity. Opt for a term life insurance from a company with a high claims settlement ratio, so that you are assured that your beneficiary can claim without hassles, in your absence.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>The salient features and benefits of unit linked insurance plans are:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Unit Linked Insurance Plans ULIP are life insurance policies especially designed for wealth creation and life protection, thus, offering the dual benefits of investment-cum-protection.</li>
                                <li>The premium payments are divided into two parts – one serves the purpose of life cover for the policyholder, while the other part is diverted towards a pool of funds. These funds are then invested in debt or equity mutual fund investments, or a mix of both.</li>
                                <li>Unit Linked Insurance Plans ensures policyholders the flexibility to select the amount of life cover, as per their objectives.</li>
                                <li>ULIPs generally provides a life cover that is 10 times the annual premium payment.</li>
                                <li>Unit Linked Insurance Plans are classified under Debt Funds, Equity Funds and Balanced Funds, which is a blend of both.</li>
                                <li>For debt funds, the investments are made in government bonds, while for equity funds, the investments are made towards company shares. - As a result, for balanced funds, the total fund is equally divided between equity and debt investment instruments.</li>
                                <li>As the portfolio investments in a variety of investment instruments, policyholders of life insurance plans can select their investments as per their objectives and risk appetites. Equity funds generate high returns over a short-term and, therefore, are best suited for investors with high risk appetites. On the other hand, the returns on debt funds are not as high as in equity funds, but act as a steady and reliable source of income over the long term. Hence, they meet the investment goals of investors with low-risk appetites. Investors with medium risk-appetites can focus on investments in balanced funds.</li>
                                <li>ULIPs offer the benefit of withdrawing a specific part of the money invested in the life insurance plan during unpredicted personal and medical emergencies.</li>
                                <li>ULIPs are tailor-made to meet the long-term financial goals of policyholders like child’s higher education and marriage, retirement plans, etc.</li>
                                <li>Policyholders are eligible for tax benefits under Sections 80C, 80CCC and 10(10D) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.</li>

                        <div className="cc__bodytext text-left" data-cms-attr="class:ccbodytextClass" data-cms-content="md:ccbodytext"><p>Life insurance companies offer additional riders to supplement your insurance plan. These offers benefits over and above the life covers included in your policy. Opt for riders only if it suits your unique requirements. It is neither wise to be under-insured, nor to be over-insured. Here are some of the useful riders that you may consider while buying a life insurance policy:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Critical Illness:</strong> This add-on rider covers illnesses that are usually not covered in life insurance plans. These offer covers on medical expenditures related to illnesses such as cancer, heart attack, stroke, paralysis, kidney failure, etc. The treatment for such illnesses not only burns a hole in our pockets, but is a cause of emotional turmoil as well. Therefore, being financially prepared for such exigencies is a wise move. Besides, it saves us from emotional stress to a great extent. The lump sum can be availed on the policyholder being diagnosed of any of these illnesses.</li>
                                <li><strong>Accidental Death</strong> An Accidental Death rider keeps the policyholder’s family financially covered in case of his/her death. The additional lump sum offered to the beneficiary by such riders enables the family to meet long and short-term financial objectives like immediate family expenditures, outstanding debts of the policyholder (if any), child’s education and marriage, etc. Apart from being a stable source of income, it acts as an emotional support and saves the family from an impending debt burden. Income Benefit Rider This rider assures the policyholder’s family of a reliable and steady source of income after his/her unforeseen death. This rider proves to be especially beneficial when the policyholder is the sole breadwinner of the family. This rider relieves the family from financial stress and instability, securing their lives.</li>
                                <li><strong>Waiver of Premium:</strong> In situations when the policyholder is unable to pay premiums due to disability or death of the policyholder where the insured and policyholder are different, this rider prevents the life insurance policy from lapsing and ensures that the policyholder can avail the pre-decided maturity benefits.</li>
                                <li><strong>Partial and Permanent Disability:</strong> There is no guarantee to the kind of surprises that life throws on us, and surprises are not always good. Hence, it is best to be prepared for different eventualities, if it may arise. A partial or permanent disability rider serves as a much-needed financial support for the policyholder and his/her family when there is lack of a steady source of income due to the disability. Insurance companies usually offer 10% of total sum assured on such riders. Since riders offer the aforementioned benefits, it is recommended that you purchase them if they meet your requirements. However, it is essential to do your research and make sure that you do not make any unnecessary purchases as you may end up spending money for something that you may never even use. Go through each of the riders and purchase them only if they provide the benefits that you will actually require at some point in time.</li>

                        <div className="cc__bodytext text-left" data-cms-attr="class:ccbodytextClass" data-cms-content="md:ccbodytext"><p>Here are the factors to help you understand how your life insurance premium will be calculated:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Your premiums would be lower if you buy a life insurance plan at a younger age. With your increasing age, your insurer’s level of risk will also increase. Hence, insurance companies will up their premium amount. So, don’t wait till you grey, apply today!</li>
                                <li><strong>Gender:</strong> Research says that women generally live longer than men. This means life insurance companies interpret men as riskier applicants than women. Therefore, their premiums too are slightly lower than that of men. So, your life insurance premium does depend on your gender too!</li>
                                <li><strong>Lifestyle habits:</strong> Insurance companies usually calculate premiums based on risk factors like your smoking, intake of drugs and alcohol drinking habit. These habits enhance the chances of lifestyle diseases, making insurance companies charge a higher premium from you. Insurers usually double the premium amount for smokers as compared to what they do from non-smokers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Duration of coverage:</strong> The longer the duration of your coverage, the greater is the risk undertaken by the insurance company. Short-term life insurance plans have lower premiums than long-term life insurance plans. Though, short term life insurance policies have lower premium than long term life insurance policies, the coverage/ policy term offered is also lower. Plan for a cover that protects you for a longer duration.</li>
                                <li><strong>Existing health condition:</strong> Most insurance companies makes it mandatory for applicants to submit their health records, which is thoroughly checked for signs of chronic illnesses or potential health problems that might make them high-risk customers. Applicants with clean health records are eligible for availing lower premium rates than those with records of health issues or have symptoms indicating at the same.</li>
                                <li><strong>Medical history:</strong> The medical history of an applicant is one of the parameters that decide the premium amounts they will be eligible for. The lack of medical history of life-threatening diseases like cancer improves their chances of having to pay a comparatively lower premium than those with medical records that indicate at a high scope of them contracting the hereditary health conditions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Obesity is the root cause of various medical conditions like blood pressure, coronary heart diseases, stroke, osteoarthritis, cancer, etc. that can lead to further complications. Hence, applicants who are obese are charged higher premium because they are viewed as potentially high-risk customers.</li>
                                <li><strong>Participation in adventure sports:</strong> Participation in activities that cause an adrenaline rush like mountain climbing, trekking, driving fast cars, bungie jumping, scuba diving, etc. involve high risks. Therefore, insurance companies charge a higher premium from adventure sports enthusiasts than those who do not enjoy such activities.</li>
                                <li><strong>Profession:</strong> Applicants working in industries like mining, oil and gas, fisheries, etc., are at a higher risk of fatal medical and health conditions. Covering such applicants through a health insurance policy also involves high risk for insurance companies. This explains the reason why such applicants are offered higher premiums than those who are employed in fields that are perceived to be safer like finance, marketing, etc.</li>

                            <p>Most life insurance companies have embraced digitalization for the convenience of their customers, contributing to customer delight. These payments can be done through the following ways:
The available online payment platforms are net banking, debit/credit card, mobile banking, etc. You can also opt for the auto-debit option by giving your bank the mandate to deduct the pre-determined premium amount from your account on specific dates, as per your policy terms - quarterly, half-yearly, monthly, or annually. The payment deduction can be done through, Electronic Clearing Service (ECS), NEFT, Standing Instructions (SI) mandate, eCMS, auto-debit facility, etc., as per your preference. However, these online payments options may vary among life insurance companies. These online payments can be completed by logging into the official website of your life insurance company or through the internet banking platform of your bank.</p>
                            <p><strong>Life Insurance Offline Payment</strong></p>
                            <p>For policyholders who prefer making their premium payments offline, it can be done in the form of cash or cheque. Cheques can be deposited by visiting any branch of the insurance company, while cash payments can be done through bank transfers in the name of the relevant life insurance company.</p>
                            <p><strong>Impact of GST on Life Insurance Plans </strong></p>
                            <p>The implementation of GST (Goods and Services Tax) has had an impact on life insurance plans as the premium payments are not exempted for it.
Services Accounting Code (SAC) is applicable on life insurance premium payments. The SAC for GST classification for services related to life insurance policies, excluding reinsurance services, is GST Code for Life Insurance. For pension services, the applicable SAC GST code is 997131.</p>

                                <li>At what age will you retire?</li>
                                <li>Is your spouse working? If yes, you can plan the premium amount based on the ratio of contribution to the family’s income.</li>
                                <li>How much will your children’s education cost?</li>
                                <li>Do you have any loan to be paid-off? You are likely to consider the loan amount as your life insurance cover. Because you do not want your family to suffer or undergo hardships to repay debts against your name, in case of unfortunate eventuality.</li>
                                <li>What are your retirement goals? How much money would you require once you retire?</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>For children’s education, you can plan separately with the help of a child plan. To plan your retirement, you can invest in a retirement plan.</p>
                            <p>If you are planning to buy a pure life insurance cover – a term plan is highly recommended. Opt for a life insurance cover that is 8 to 10 times of your annual income.</p>
                            <p>For example, if annual income is Rs.5 lakh, the life insurance cover (sum assured) should be approximately Rs.40 lakh.
Regardless of the life insurance plan you purchase, you must check the claim settlement ratio of each life insurance company to assess the reliability and efficiency of their services.</p>

                        <div className="cc__bodytext text-left" data-cms-attr="class:ccbodytextClass" data-cms-content="md:ccbodytext"><p>There are many life insurance companies in India, and each company offers wide range of life insurance plans designed for varied needs of their customers.

                                <li><p><strong>Analyze your coverage</strong> The amount of income you offer to your family members who are dependent on you, your loans and financial expenses would help you analyse the coverage you should opt for on your policy. This will enable you to efficiently secure your family financially in your absence.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p><strong>Ensure your premium payment capacity</strong> Ensure you have capacity to pay the premiums.

                                </li>
                                <li><p><strong>Do not jump for riders unnecessary</strong> If you increase the coverage offered under your basic life insurance policy, you may consider buying riders that would fulfil more requirements such as health etc. However, select the riders wisely. Opt for only those that are aligned to your unique objectives. Do not jump for them, if they are not required.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li><p><strong>Life Coverage Premium:</strong> First and foremost, ensure you are buying an adequate life cover and are neither over-insured nor under-insured. After you have enlisted some policies, based on their features and benefits, you need to compare the premiums for the same coverage amount offered by each one of them.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p><strong>Features of the Life Insurance Plan:</strong> Compare features of different life insurance features offered by various life insurance companies. Always make sure you opt for a comprehensive life insurance policy with customizable policy tenure, sum assured, premium paying mode and frequency, payouts, etc., so that you can design it further to your unique needs.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p><strong>Life Insurance Riders:</strong> Riders are add-ons that enhance your basic life insurance coverage. The life insurance riders are optional paid features. However, before buying a life insurance plan online, you should watch out for the riders you want to buy, if they are offered by a different insurer as an in-built feature. Some of the important riders you may wish to add to your policy may be available as a feature of the plan offered by a different life insurance company. However, make sure that you opt for riders only if you genuinely need them as opposed to opting for one and over-insuring your life insurance policy.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li><p><strong>Claim Settlement Ratio:</strong> Claim settlement ratio of the company symbolizes the proportion of the total claims settled against the total number of claims filed. Higher the claim settlement ratio, the better. A higher ratio implies that the chances of your claim getting settled are also greater. For each life insurance company, the claim settlement ratio changes every year. Therefore, it is an important factor while comparing life insurance plans.</p>
                                </li>
